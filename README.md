When I think about interpreting user needs, it really comes down to slowing down and actually listening. Not just hearing what the user says, but trying to understand what they really mean underneath it. It is not always about what features they ask for directly, sometimes it is about the problems they are trying to solve or the experience they wish they had. Creating user stories makes this so much easier. It forces you to put yourself in their shoes. You are not just writing technical requirements anymore, you are telling a story about what they want to do and why it matters to them. That shift changes everything. It keeps the focus on real people instead of just code or features. It keeps you grounded when you are building, reminding you who you are doing the work for.

My approach to developing programs definitely changed after working through this course. Before, I thought you just planned everything upfront and then charged forward, but Agile taught me it is about building a little, learning a little, adjusting, and repeating. I like breaking work down into small, manageable chunks instead of getting overwhelmed by the big picture. I want to bring Sprint Planning and Retrospectives into any project or team evironment in the future. Sprint Planning helps everyone know exactly what we are trying to achieve. And Retrospectives, honestly, they are the most important; they let the you step back, breathe, and figure out how to keep getting bette. I want my future work to always have that rhythm of steady progress and honest reflection.

Honestly, to me, being a good team member in software development is about so much more than just doing your part. It is about being someone the team can truly rely on, someone who is not just showing, but actually being there, ready to jump in whenever needed. It means being open to feedback even when it hurts your pride or ego, because at the end of the day everyone is working toward the same goal of making the best product possible. It also means being willing to help others even when it is not technically your responsibility. You cannot just focus on your own tasks and forget the bigger picture. A good team member looks around, sees where help is needed, and offers it without being asked. They communicate openly, share updates even when things are not perfect, and stay flexible when priorities inevitably shift. Plans will always change, that is just how projects go, and the best teammates are the ones who can roll with it and still keep the energy positive. In the end, I really believe being a good team member is not just about building great software. It is about building trust, building strong connections with the people you are working with, and making sure everyone crosses the finish line together.
